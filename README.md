# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ESDIR - The Electromechanical Self-Driven Intelligent Rover
## Project Overview
### Project Title:
ESDIR - The Electromechanical Self-Driven Intelligent Rover
### Team Name:
4RoboTech
### Time frame:
6 – 8 Months
### Project Summary:
The project aims to develop an autonomous delivery robot capable of navigating through a campus environment, picking up food orders, and delivering them to designated locations. Additionally, a user-friendly web application will be built to facilitate delivery requests and administer the system.
## Project Objectives
- Develop a robot capable of autonomous navigation through a maze while avoiding obstacles and people.
- Build a web application with robust user authentication for submitting delivery requests.
- Implement two-factor authentication for user security.
- Utilize machine learning for object detection during robot navigation.
- Develop features for notifying users of obstacles and enabling the robot to return.
## Project Methodology
The project will follow a structured approach including:
- Building the robot and ensuring its functionality.
- Developing the web application with user-friendly interfaces.
- Implementing necessary security measures such as two-factor authentication.
- Integrating machine learning algorithms for object detection.
- Testing and refining both the robot and web application.
## Project Risk Management
The project will address various risks including theft prevention, safeguarding against falls and collisions, and ensuring safe navigation in different terrains.
