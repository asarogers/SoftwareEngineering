# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**Download**

Let's begin with the website set up

1.  Download Node.js here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/current>
2.  Install VS Code: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

1.  Ensure you add VS Code to path

4.  Install git ot github desktop

1.  <https://desktop.github.com/>
2.  https://git-scm.com/downloads

**Set up**

1) Open terminal

- Click the windows button

- Type "terminal", click on terminal

2) Clone the repo

- Type "git clone <https://github.com/asarogers/SoftwareEngineering.git>" in the terminal window to clone the repo

3) Start the project

- Type "pwd" in the terminal to get the current path

- Save that path

- Open up visual studio code

- Navigate to the path and open the project

- Open up a terminal in your Visual Studio Code project

- Type "npm i -f" in your Visual Studio Code

- Type "npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object @emotion/react @emotion/styled @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @mui/material @mui/styles @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event bcryptjs crypto-browserify dot mysql2 parsed react react-dom react-google-maps react-router-dom react-scripts socket.io-client web-vitals -f" in the terminal and run it

**Start the Project**

In your Visual Studio Code,

Run the following command: "npm start" in your terminal

If the project does not start, delete your node_modules

Then Type "npm i -f" in your Visual Studio Code

Type "npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object @emotion/react @emotion/styled @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @mui/material @mui/styles @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event bcryptjs crypto-browserify dot mysql2 parsed react react-dom react-google-maps react-router-dom react-scripts socket.io-client web-vitals -f" in the terminal and run it

Retype "npm start" in terminal

Connecting Lidar: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iKLvyU2_QE&t=135s>

Coding Lidar:

I don't recall the full set up process, but I am sure you can find it on youtube. All you need to do is plug in the raspberry pi 4 into the monitor, give it power, and go through the setup process that it prompts you

Connecting to the wifi

After you are set up, you'll have a basic Linux home screen, top right hand corner is the wifi, go ahead and connect

We need the IP address

Open the terminal, type ipconfig, you have your ip address.
