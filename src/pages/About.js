            ESDIR is a robot capable of efficiently maneuvering through a maze,
            avoiding obstacles and objects, while reaching its intended
            destination.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            It is controlled through the use of a web application with robust
            user authentication features, which enable users to submit delivery
            requests. These locations come from a pre-defined list of campus
            buildings, each linked to specific GPS locations. Admins will have
            the ability to add GPS locations to the list making this product
            more efficient for users.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We have hopes that this project will challenge more engineers and
            developers to keep creating innovation giving lifeâ€™s tasks more
            simplicity. ESDIR where Service is Sovereignty.
